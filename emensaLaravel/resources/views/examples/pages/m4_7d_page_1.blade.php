        SIMPLIFY
        Simplicity forces you to be intentional. It focuses your effort in trying to get to the essence of things, also allowing your mind to rest by discarding the noise surrounding unneeded things.

        LEARN SILENCE
        Not everything needs a reaction, and not everything requires an opinion. It’s when and how you express your thoughts.

        STOP, LOOK, DECIDE
        Often a problem will get you stressed, or frustrated, preventing you from working out a solution. Stop one second, look at the whole picture, and then find the solution.

        PLAN B
        Plans don’t survive the real world. It is important, now more than ever, to have a Plan B. Be ready for the worst. When it happens, you’ll know what to do.
